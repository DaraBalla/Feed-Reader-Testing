# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.


## How to run this test?

See https://daraballa.github.io/Feed-Reader-Testing/.


## How to run this project locally

Click "Clone in Desktop" / "Download ZIP"
After downloading the ZIP, unzip the file
Open the unziped folder
Open index.html on your browser
There should be several test results at the bottom of the screen that says how many specs and failures are there


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.


## What have I learnt?

I have learnt how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
